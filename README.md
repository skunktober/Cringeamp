CRINGEAMP is a Python-based media player that supports .mp3, .wav, .ogg and .flac. It was created with a desire to have a simple media player out of the box that just works. Files are loaded through opening a folder, in which the player will grab all files that match the audio formats above.

CRINGEAMP comes with built-in metadata scraping, volume control, track scrubbing and more built in. Since it's built with Python, it's totally cross-platform too.

## Dependencies
CRINGEAMP will automatically detect if certain dependencies aren't installed, and will attempt to install them itself.*

- Python is obviously needed to run the application.
- PyGame
- Pillow
- Mutagen
